# PacMan
My first pacman exercise

# Description:
This is a simple game to see the PacMan moving across your browser. We used 4 images of PacMan (Images with mouth open and close facing right and left sides). We used the setTimeout function and called the function Run() to run every 200ms. This makes the PacMan move every 200ms.The function CheckPageBounds is written to reverse the PacMan direction when it hits the window innerWidth.

# How to Run:
Download all the files and run the html file in your Chrome browser(recommended). You will see a PacMan on your screen. Click on to the PacMan image and you can see it moving across the browser. Once it hits the right end of your screen, it bounces back and starts moving towards the other direction.

# Roadmap of future improvements:
I'm planning to add music to it and change its color when it moves. Once it hits the window on the right, we can make another one appear and follow the first one.
