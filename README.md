# PacMan
My first pacman exercise
This is a simple game to see the PacMan moving across your browser. 

# How to Play
Download and run the html file in your Chrome browser(recommended). You will see a PacMan on your screen. Click on to the PacMan image and you can see it moving across the browser. Once it hits the right end of your screen, it bounces back and starts moving towards the other direction.

# Code Info
We used 4 images of PacMan (Images with mouth open and close facing the right side, and images with mouth open and close facing the left side). We used the setTimeout function and called the function Run() to run every 200ms. This makes the PacMan move every 200ms.
The function CheckPageBounds is written to reverse the PacMan direction when it hits the window innerWidth.
